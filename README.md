# DataTrek-VR
This project uses Google VR SDK and Unity to create a special data visulation experience.

### The Experience
When using the system, the player will be standing on a hoverboard and fly around in a 3D Coordinate System. The data points are put in the 3D space. The user can have close experience of the clusters, network, simlarity of the data.
